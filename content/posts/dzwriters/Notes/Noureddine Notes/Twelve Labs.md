One exciting startup building next-generation video search capabilities is Twelve Labs, which [announced](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/16/twelve-labs-makes-searching-inside-videos-simple-and-powerful-propelled-by-5m-seed-round/ "https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/16/twelve-labs-makes-searching-inside-videos-simple-and-powerful-propelled-by-5m-seed-round/") its seed financing earlier this month. Twelve Labs fuses cutting-edge NLP and computer vision to enable precise semantic search within videos. “Multimodal AI” like this—that is, AI that ingests and synthesizes data from multiple informational modalities at once, like image and audio—will play a central role in AI’s future.

“Large language models are accomplishing incredible things today. We think large multimodal neural networks for video are the obvious next step,” said Twelve Labs cofounder/CEO Jae Lee. “Video embeddings generated by these networks will supercharge current and future video-driven applications with an intelligence that we’ve never seen before.” [[Notes/Noureddine Notes/A Wave Of Billion-Dollar Language AI Startups Is Coming]]
