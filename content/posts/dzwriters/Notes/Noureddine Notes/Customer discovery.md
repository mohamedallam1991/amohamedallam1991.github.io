# What are the strategies used in Customer Discovery ?

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the strategies used in customer discovery will vary depending on the specific business and industry. However, some common strategies that may be used include conducting market research, talking to potential customers, and testing prototypes with target users. 

## Conducting market research

One way to learn more about potential customers is to conduct market research. This can involve surveying a target market, interviewing customers or experts in the field, or observing customer behavior. This type of research can help entrepreneurs gather insights into what potential customers might want or need from a product or service.

## Talking to potential customers

Another way to gain insights into potential customers is to simply talk to them. This can be done through informal conversations, surveys, or focus groups. This type of customer discovery can help entrepreneurs get a better understanding of what potential customers are looking for and how they might use a product or service.



## Testing prototypes with target users

A third way to learn more about potential customers is to test prototypes with them. This can help entrepreneurs understand how potential customers interact with a product or service and what they think about it. It can also provide insights into how well a product or service meets the needs of potential customers.
