A storyboard in [[agile]] is a tool that helps project managers and developers to visualize the user stories and tasks involved in a project. It is a way of organizing and tracking the progress of the project, and can be used to identify potential risks and issues.

The storyboard is used to help the team visualize the user stories and break them down into tasks. The [[grooming]] process is used to estimate the effort required to complete the user story.
