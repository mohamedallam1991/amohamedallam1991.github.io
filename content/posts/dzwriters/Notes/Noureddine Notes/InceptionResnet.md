InceptionResnet is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that was designed to improve upon the Inception architecture. It was developed by Google Brain and introduced in 2016. The InceptionResnet architecture is a modification of the Inception architecture that introduces residual connections. These connections help to improve the accuracy of the network by allowing for better gradient flow during training.
