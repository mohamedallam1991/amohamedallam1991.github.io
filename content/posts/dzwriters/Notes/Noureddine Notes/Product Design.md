# What is Product Design ? 

Product design is the process of creating new products. It involves the creation of new ideas and the development of those ideas into tangible products. The product design process can be divided into four main stages: ideation, concept development, prototyping, and testing.

## Ideation

Ideation is the first stage of the product design process. This is when designers generate new ideas for products. They may do this by brainstorming, researching, or observing users. Once they have some ideas, they will start to develop them into concepts.

## Concept Development

Concept development is the second stage of the product design process. This is when designers take their ideas and turn them into concrete concepts. They will create sketches, prototypes, or models of their ideas to communicate them to others. At this stage, designers often work with engineers to make sure their concepts are feasible.

## Prototyping

Prototyping is the third stage of the product design process. This is when designers create prototypes of their concepts to test them. Prototypes can be made using different techniques such as 3D printing, computer-aided design (CAD), or hand-building. They help designers evaluate whether a concept is feasible and how users will interact with it.

## Testing

Testing is the fourth and final stage of the product design process. This is when designers test their prototypes with users. Testing helps designers understand how well a prototype works and identify any problems with it. Based on the results of testing, designers may make changes to their prototypes before they are ready to be mass-produced. 

[[5 Proven ways to improve your Product Thinking ðŸŽ©]]

# Product thinking
1.	Product thinking is a mindset and approach to product development that starts with the customer first, rather than the technology.
2.	It begins with identifying customer needs and desires, and only then developing a solution that meets those needs in the most effective way possible.
3.	The focus is on creating value for the customer, rather than on the technology itself.
4.	This approach often leads to simpler, more elegant solutions that are easier to use and more likely to be successful in the marketplace
5.	

# Concepts 


# Lean startup 
This is a method for developing businesses and products, which aims to shorten development cycles and rapidly discover if a proposed business model is viable. The lean startup method can be used in conjunction with user story mapping to validate user stories and assess whether they are likely to lead to successful outcomes. 
# Design Thinking

Design thinking is a process for creative problem solving. It is a way of thinking that emphasizes the userâ€™s needs and experience. Design thinking is used in many fields, such as product design, architecture, urban planning, and education.

This is a human-centered approach to problem solving that can be used to develop new products or services. Design thinking begins with an understanding of the userâ€™s needs and then uses creative methods to generate new ideas that address those needs. 

# Lean UX

Lean UX is a methodology for designing user experiences that focuses on the needs of the user, rather than the preferences of the designer. Lean UX is based on the principles of lean manufacturing, which emphasize efficiency and waste reduction.

# Agile Methodology

Agile methodology is a approach to project management that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement. Agile methodology is often used in software development projects. 

# User Story Mapping
User story mapping is a technique for organizing and prioritizing user stories. User stories are short descriptions of features or functionality that are desired by the user. User story mapping can help ensure that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the projectâ€™s goals and requirements. 

This technique is used to help product managers and developers understand the userâ€™s journey through the product. User story mapping is a visual way to organize user stories and track progress from idea to release. 


# Customer Journey Mapping 
Customer journey mapping is a technique for understanding the experience of customers as they interact with a company or product. Customer journey maps can help identify potential pain points and areas for improvement. 
## What is a Customer Journey Map? 

A customer journey map is a visual representation of the steps a customer takes when interacting with a company or product. Journey maps can be used to identify potential pain points and areas for improvement. 

## Why Use Customer Journey Maps? 

Customer journey maps can help companies improve the customer experience by identifying potential problems and areas for improvement. Journey maps can also help companies better understand their customers and what they want or need from their interactions with the company. 

## How to Create a Customer Journey Map 

There are a few different ways to create customer journey maps. One way is to use a software program like Lucidchart or Gliffy. Another way is to create a physical map using post-it notes or index cards. 

To create a customer journey map, you will need to gather data from your customers. This can be done through surveys, interviews, or focus groups. Once you have this data, you can begin creating your map. 

Start by creating a list of all the steps your customers take when interacting with your company or product. Then, create a visual representation of these steps using post-it notes or index cards. Once you have your map created, you can start identifying potential pain points and areas for improvement.
# Value Proposition Design 
Value proposition design is a framework for creating products and services that deliver value to customers. The framework is based on the premise that every product or service has a value proposition, which is the customer's reason for buying it. 
# A/B Testing 
A/B testing is a method of experimentation where two or more variants of a product are compared against each other to determine which one performs better. A/B tests are typically used to test new features or redesigns, but can also be used to test anything that can be measured, such as button colors, headline text, or images. 

This is a method of testing in which two versions of a product are created and then tested against each other to see which one performs better. A/B testing can be used to test different hypotheses about how a product should be designed or used, and it can help developers identify areas where there is room for improvement.
# Prototyping 
Prototyping is the process of creating a model of a product or system. Prototypes can be used to test ideas, concepts, and functionality. They can also be used to communicate ideas and get feedback from stakeholders. 

This is a technique that can be used to test new product ideas quickly and cheaply. By creating a prototype, developers can get feedback from users early in the product development process, which can help them make more informed decisions about the direction of the product. 
# Design Sprint 
A design sprint is a five-day process for solving problems and testing new ideas. The sprint is a structured process that brings together stakeholders from different disciplines to focus on a specific problem. The goal of the sprint is to generate solutions that can be implemented quickly and with minimal risk.
