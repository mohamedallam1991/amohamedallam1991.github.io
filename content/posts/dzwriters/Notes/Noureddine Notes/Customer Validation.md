> [!info]- **Customer validation**
> **Customer validation** is a process in which a startup company test its product concepts and hypotheses with potential customers. The goal is to gather feedback about the product in order to validate or invalidate the hypotheses. 

# What are the strategies for Customer Validation ?

There are a few key strategies for customer validation:

1. **Identify your target market**: who is most likely to use and benefit from your product or service?

2. **Research your target market**: learn as much as you can about their needs, wants, and pain points

3. **Build a minimum viable product (MVP)**: create a version of your product or service that is bare-bones but still functional

4. **Test your MVP with potential customers**: get feedback on everything from the user experience to the pricing

5. **Iterate based on feedback**: make changes to your MVP based on what customers say they want or need
