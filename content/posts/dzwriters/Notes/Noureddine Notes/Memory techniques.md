	I've been using memory palaces for years. I'm a trial attorney and there's no way I could adequately practice law without them. One thing to remember is that anything and everything can be a memory palace. Oh, you have a dog, that dog can be a memory palace.  A bottle, a gun, a sword, even a movie---anything and everything. The more you use these techniques, the faster you'll get at it. I've gone from memorizing single words to memorizing full paragraphs at each location. I've gotten to the point where it doesn't matter what language the paragraph might be. As long as I can figure out the sounds, I can remember the paragraph. But this takes daily practice--at least one solid hour per day, every day without exception. In fact, I find that it works best for practice in a language you don't understand because then what you really need to remember in your own language will be substantially easier. 
	
	If you really, really want to advance at this stuff, get a sketch book. Draw out your memory palaces and carry that book with you everywhere you go. Number each location in your palace. Pull that book out and review your palaces every day. I'm up to two books with about 200 memory palaces that average about 20 locations per memory palace. (Some are small ones--two to four locations, others are large with up to 50 locations.) 
	
	Also, one of the break through things for me was to understand that what you're really doing is organizing information so that it is retrievable with minimal effort.*
