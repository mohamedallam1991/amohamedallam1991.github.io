# BIO
I'm a Computer Science Researcher with a focus on vehicular networks, distributed systems, streaming, and anonymous networks. I'm interested in writing, taking notes, knowledge management, meta-learning, business, and startups.  

This year, I launched a new startup called YouWrite in France with goal to make writing easier and faster.
