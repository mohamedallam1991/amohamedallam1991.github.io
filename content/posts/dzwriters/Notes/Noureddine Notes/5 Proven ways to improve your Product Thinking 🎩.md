# 5 Proven ways to improve your Product Thinking 🎩  
  
1️⃣ Be a meticulous observer of life.  
  
Observe your day-to-day life and those around you: When do you feel delighted or annoyed by a product? When do your friends show their excitement or complain about a product or experience?  
  
2️⃣ Practice product thinking.  
  
For the next 30 days, pause for 3 minutes and ask yourself the following questions every time you use a product. Repeat this exercise till it becomes second nature (thanks Albert Hwang for the inspiration):  
  
▪️Why does this product exist?  
▪️What problem does it solve? For whom?  
▪️What is a one-liner value prop for this product?  
  
3️⃣ Be a product tinkerer.  
  
Every week, try at least one new product, feature, or service. Understand the why, what, and how behind the product.  
  
4️⃣ Develop a holistic understanding.  
  
Understand the ecosystem by staying up-to-date with product news and best practices.

5️⃣ Strengthen your strategic thinking.  
  
Every week, have at least one intellectual conversation or reflection on product strategy. How would you help Product X win over Audience Y? Which decision drives the success of Product X and why? What would you build to 10x the growth of Product X?
